Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in? Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.

What we tell our clients, and one of the things that my team has been telling our clients for the last two years, is we need to pay more for impressions, but we should buy way fewer impressions.

I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint. And secondly, we have an architecture that doesn’t force you to buy layer 3 switches when you actually go and put a virtualized stack of hardware together to run the software. And that has great advantage, especially in geographies where power consumption — and certainly price — is very important. So think about parts of Europe, Latin America, certainly, all the developing countries — that is a huge advantage for us. So we feel very good about our position and in that space.",0.0,0,127,0.2

When it comes to providers, some support all of the formats, some support some of the formats, and some only one of the formats. Rarely does any one provider support streaming of content in Windows Media, Flash, QuickTime, and Real formats. While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so. Providers should be upfront and honest about what they support today and what they may support down the road. On Microsoft’s and Adobe’s websites, you can see who is certified to provide delivery services in both of their formats. ",0.0,0,127,0.3

There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,0,127,0.2

These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",1.0,0,127,0.2

The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.
