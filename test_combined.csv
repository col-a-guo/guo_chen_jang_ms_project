Zaslav said that, currently,  Discovery Health — which OWN is essentially taking over — gets minuscule carriage fees compared to other  Discovery networks (SNL Kagan estimates  Discovery Health gets an average of 12 cents per subscriber per month from distributors). That should change once Oprah takes control. “We think there is a meaningful opportunity if we can build a strong network with the Oprah brand and all the resources that we’re putting on it,” Zaslav said. “We’re bringing a lot of value to the cable industry — Oprah herself coming to cable is a big value. If we can build that, our position is that we should be able to get value over time. We are having discussions with distributors now, and those are ongoing.” Zaslav wouldn’t say what the network will ask for in carriage fees. Several reports have estimated OWN could attract between 40 cents and 50 cents per subscriber per month. Zaslav was also encouraged by what he characterized as a strong upfront market, which should drive increases in advertising. He added that ad revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, and guidance for the third quarter was for another increase of 13% or more. “We will be [up] more,” Zaslav said. The  Discovery CEO also had high praise for the ID: Investigation  Discovery network, which he said is the fastest growing network in the  Discovery Communications fold. And while he said that all of  Discovery ’s networks are profitable, FitTV and Military Channel may undergo some changes in the future, perhaps along the lines of its  Discovery Kids network, which in a joint venture with toymaker Hasbro will relaunch in October as The Hub. “Some of our channels, we are trying to figure out what’s the best use,” Zaslav said. “They are profitable today, and if we had our way we would build those channels ourselves. FitTV and Military are two of the channels that we’re trying to think of; for now they’re profi table but what could they be to have a bigger audience, a stronger brand, a bigger contribution? “We have been investing less in those channels as we look at our opportunities either with a joint venture opportunity, which we would only do if we thought that somebody brought something to the table that would make the channel significantly more valuable, like an Oprah or Hasbro.”",0.0,118,719,0.2

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size. The CDN cost savings alone are enough to make VOD catalogue owners evaluate the benefits of re-encoding their content libraries to take advantage of these new processes— especially now, when quality, price and speed are no longer obstacles.",0.0,118,719,0.3

All of the different bitrate streams are segmented into chunks along with the creation of a manifest file. The reason for this is so that viewers can then download or stream the chunk that is best suited to their current bandwidth situation. The viewer can do this because they are made aware of all the available chunks at differing bit rates by the manifest file.,0.0,103,587,0.2

Most of what takes place once the signals reach the encoder farms tends to be automatic—the result of plenty of programming ahead of time—as is distribution to the various carriers. But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.",1.0,118,719,0.2
