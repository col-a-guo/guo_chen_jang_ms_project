He responded, “As I understand it, SVTHEVC and SVT-VP9 were designed for live encoding, and [are] not really useful for other use cases. The threading performance is nearly linear, which means more cores = much faster encodes. Other codecs are not as efficient with many threads. SVT-AV1 performs very favorably to libaom, and delivers solid gains all  the way into x264 computational complexity. We  (the SVT community) feel very good about SVT- AV1, and are continuing to invest in it. It’s among the top most well-designed encoders.”",1.0,111,676,0.2

Customizing encoding parameters for an individual scene should be more efficient than trying to find the optimal encoding configuration for a segment containing two or more scenes that could comprise wildly different content. In addition, changing encoding parameters at a scene change would obviously be less noticeable than changing parameters within a scene. Ultimately, Netflix’s computed efficiency numbers speak for themselves; as measured by VMAF, dynamic optimization enabled Netflix to reduce the bitrate of x264, VP9 (libvpx), and x265 by 28.04%, 37.61%, and 33.51%, respectively, while retaining the same quality.",0.0,99,681,0.2
