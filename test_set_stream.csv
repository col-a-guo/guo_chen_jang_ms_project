If a certain corporate office needs a low bandwidth (e.g., 400Kbps) due to its current bandwidth constraints, there’s no reason to penalize the rest of the viewers who are on a multicast-enabled portion of the network. The ability to send both high-bandwidth IP multicast and varying bandwidth peer-assisted multicast is one of FMS 4’s strong points.”"
