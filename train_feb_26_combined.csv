The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.

I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint.

But their complaints are quickly being brushed aside in the face of overwhelming demand by an ever-growing number of users that are enthusiastically adopting the concept. Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,0,127,0.2

Many of these elements are well on their way to being prevalent. Enough TV sets, OTT STBs and other devices supporting 4K resolutions are currently seeing growing adoption. Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it. To be sure, the more consumers that have 4K enabled TV sets, the more the demand for 4K services will grow. The chicken and the egg are both developing quite nicely and there will be a tipping point at some time in the near future. ",0.0,0,127,0.1

Customizing encoding parameters for an individual scene should be more efficient than trying to find the optimal encoding configuration for a segment containing two or more scenes that could comprise wildly different content. In addition, changing encoding parameters at a scene change would obviously be less noticeable than changing parameters within a scene. Ultimately, Netflix’s computed efficiency numbers speak for themselves; as measured by VMAF, dynamic optimization enabled Netflix to reduce the bitrate of x264, VP9 (libvpx), and x265 by 28.04%, 37.61%, and 33.51%, respectively, while retaining the same quality.",0.0,0,99,0.2

First, what percentage of rogue users now relying on shared credentials will convert to their own paid accounts? Second, what percentage of members will agree to a $7.99 surcharge to keep their friends/family members aboard? (Note that in this case, it’s possible there may be little impact on  Netflix ’s net subscriber total, but a bump in monthly spending per account, as existing members will now pay more.) Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in? Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations. Further, the cause is aided by the fact that  Netflix now offers an advertising-supported iteration for just $6.99 per month. As a result, the economic barrier to entry is lower than ever.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",1.0,0,127,0.2

However, if the impact of that change is that every device consuming the stream requires slightly more power to display the  pictures, overall, you have achieved the exact opposite of the local intention. If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

In adaptive streaming, each video file contains multiple streams encoded at different bitrates and resolutions; in the case of the video shown above in Figure 4, the adaptive bitrate stream would include both the high bitrate stream and the low bitrate version—as well as streams at other bitrates and resolutions in between—and adjusts what bitrate is actually delivered to the viewing device based on the speed of the network connection (Figure 9). If you’re watching an adaptive bitrate stream on your smart TV and you have the bandwidth available, you’ll get the highest bitrate—and highest quality—to watch. Or, if you start watching a video  on your TV, then move to your mobile phone, you’ll get the lower-bitrate version of the same video on the phone. ",1.0,0,127,0.2
