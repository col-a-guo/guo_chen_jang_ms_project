Variations on this architecture include cloud-native software that can be deployed on virtualized or containerized instances in the cloud or enterprise data centers.  While software encoding on CPU is your most flexible option, it is also likely your most expensive option requiring the most servers, rackspace, power, and cooling, making this encoding strategy undesirable, if not impractical, for edge data center environments. Other options to improve encoding densities and reduce power consumption include software encoding solutions that run on graphic processor units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, to achieve the density and low power targets of edge data center environments, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) encoding solutions are your best option. "

Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it. To be sure, the more consumers that have 4K enabled TV sets, the more the demand for 4K services will grow.

Most of what takes place once the signals reach the encoder farms tends to be automatic—the result of plenty of programming ahead of time—as is distribution to the various carriers. But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says."

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience."

Client-side is a little more mature but is also fraught with challenges that can create disruptive ad experiences. This could include player and device incompatibilities, content coming from an ad server that’s not correctly formatted for the viewer’s device, and viewers running ad blockers. Server-side insertion tends to support more devices and give you a smoother playback experience but may fail to deliver some of the interactivity advertisers want such as knowing how much of an ad the viewer actually saw. The client-side analytics can tell you that an ad didn’t play, but it doesn’t tell you where in the chain something broke. "

The threading performance is nearly linear, which means more cores = much faster encodes. Other codecs are not as efficient with many threads. SVT-AV1 performs very favorably to libaom, and delivers solid gains all  the way into x264 computational complexity.

Heck, at 40.5 seconds per file, it’s only about 10% percent slower than H.264. However, this performance schema puts the burden on the developer to create an efficient encoding program or platform. Of course, VP9 isn’t the first codec that fails to efficiently leverage multiple- core systems, and encoding programs such as Tele stream Episode have long used a technique called split and stitch to improve performance on multiple-core systems. Much like YouTube’s parallel encoding schema, split and stitch divides a single input file into multiple parts encoded separately in parallel, and then stitched back together for final output. Essentially, the 12-simultaneous encode test shown in Table 1 simulates this parallel encoding operation, which pushed the Z840 to 98%+ utilization (Figure 3). "
