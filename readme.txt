Files don't require any user input. Just install dependencies and run. Train and test for each model are in the same file.

Current version needs feb_20_stitched (test and train), feb_24_combined (test and train), and BERT_pretrain.txt to run everything.

BERTgetpretraintxt.py is set up for local and here for viewing purposes, it won't run without a much larger dataset download.

Push to Hub won't work without huggingface login.

All code is original; some AI assistance, especially on rote tasks (e.g. data cleaning, visualization, baseline comments) but minimal for important parts (i.e. the actual models, specific comments)
