If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint. And secondly, we have an architecture that doesn’t force you to buy layer 3 switches when you actually go and put a virtualized stack of hardware together to run the software. And that has great advantage, especially in geographies where power consumption — and certainly price — is very important. So think about parts of Europe, Latin America, certainly, all the developing countries — that is a huge advantage for us. So we feel very good about our position and in that space.",0.0,0,127,0.2

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors. The financial burden of those shifts into a service with a monthly fee that is often based on utilization and volume of the data. ",1.0,0,127,0.3

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain.

As a cloud-native (and specifically cloud platform-agnostic) system, OptiQ offers unprecedented real-time deployment of robust live ABR monitoring at scale across 282 public cloud availability zones in over 100 geographic regions. Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. The pay-asyou-go pricing model means that customers can scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and Nice People at Work directly into its own performance data and therefore provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain.

While this doesn’t help the issue of backhaul contention between the cellmux and the operator (via the tower and its fiber back to the network core) this capacity is often quite abundant. The bigger issue is the connection from the operator to the internet, and an alternative APN provider can really help you address this issue.

With this approach, users can shed a great deal of the capital and operating expense associated with video processing and delivery. However, such platforms generally use a onesize-fits-all approach that may not work for many video providers. Often, every aspect of the workflow—from ingest to encoding, digital rights management to packaging, and content delivery network (CDN) to video player—is a proprietary solution developed by that same vendor, who may not have a core competency in each element of a comprehensive video workflow. Customers use only the vendor’s components, so sourcing best-of-breed technology for specific parts of the workflow is not an option. These solutions are often designed around a narrow set of use cases that work well for certain requirements and less so for others, and the ability to control or tune the platform to a provider’s unique needs is limited.
