All of the different bitrate streams are segmented into chunks along with the creation of a manifest file. The reason for this is so that viewers can then download or stream the chunk that is best suited to their current bandwidth situation. The viewer can do this because they are made aware of all the available chunks at differing bit rates by the manifest file.,1.0,0,102,0.2

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,0,127,0.2

Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it. To be sure, the more consumers that have 4K enabled TV sets, the more the demand for 4K services will grow.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",1.0,0,127,0.2

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

I said that WebRTC will be ready for prime time and that 2014 it would be part of the mainstream. Although slower Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently made waves in the media by asserting that linear TV will cease to exist by 2030. Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015. The downloaded application used for webconferencing heretofore will start to become a distant memory. The browser will be king in 2015. It will not only be WebRTC but also ORTC; Microsoft’s commitment to browser based communications. The online small work group collaboration business will continue to be turned on its head. Large webconferencing players will either begin or continue to offer free or freemium services; it will be a matter of survival. Look for the SMB market to be hardest hit as small companies tend to move quicker. In the SMB market unlike the large enterprise latest versions of Chrome and IE are readily available. SMB consumers are technically astute, flexible, and price conscious. Screen sharing, white boarding and collaboration will all be executed in the browser without the need for downloads or plug-ins; in many cases for free. Although terms like Turn, Ice and Stun are not household words yet in the larger enterprise they will be in the SMB. Economics drive behavior; free is tough to compete with.

While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

While each CDN customer will have different interests in this Big Data set, building analytics and reporting is a major undertaking for an individual enterprise. However, for a CDN to do this job once—but then make it available for hundreds of customers—there is a valuable centralization of resources that generally can provide CDN clients with much better insight into the success of their content delivery than they could reasonably build for themselves. In a world where content delivery is increasingly being monetized, this is an incredibly important function. CDNs do this very well, and those that provide the critical details that can be trusted and form the basis for a content distribution rights deal become valuable partners for content deals.",0.0,0,127,0.2

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

Whether you’re using AWS, Azure, Google, or another provider’s machine learning, it’s important that the data they generate is not “vendor locked.” When information comes back from the metadata enrichment service, it may be in the form of an XML or JSON document. The system you choose should parse this data and make it easy to search against it, either from a user perspective or API perspective. To realize maximum efficiency, the metadata should be displayed clearly in a UI so that users can easily understand how and where it relates to the video. Searches that return labeled segments with proxy video allowing instant playback of the results are preferred over a simple document with a list of timecodes. ",0.0,0,127,0.3
