This might make their equipment more efficient and save 200 watts on one of their servers. Well done, very  green. However, if the impact of that change is that every device consuming the stream requires slightly more power to display the  pictures, overall, you have achieved the exact opposite of the local intention. If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors. The financial burden of those shifts into a service with a monthly fee that is often based on utilization and volume of the data. ",1.0,0,127,0.3

Specifically, given the volume of video encoded, stored, and delivered by YouTube, bandwidth costs are obviously a significant concern, and the ability to develop, customize, and continually advance a high-performance codec to meet its precise workflow needs can produce very significant cost savings. Having to work within the constraints of a standards-based codecs would be antithetical to those needs. In addition, with YouTube, Google has the single largest source of video on the internet, a big enough asset to convince CE manufacturers to support a new codec, especially if it costs less than a quarter.

A video tag could only use a single, whole, web-hosted video file for its source. Once a page loaded, the browser began downloading that file, playing it back as it received more content. There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video. Seeking to a later point in the video is slow and tedious, requiring either additional server infrastructure or simply downloading the file up to the seek point.
