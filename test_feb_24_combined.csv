If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Data download speeds for mobile users have improved by more than 30 percent since 2015, now attaining an average of 19.27Mbps, according to Speedtest. These higher speeds improve the streaming experience, which in turn drives demand for more content, but watching all of that video on a smartphone comes at a cost. The average data plan for a U.S. cellular customer is 2.5GB per month, with most of that data being used for video. Considering that streaming one hour of HD video on Netflix can consume as much as 3GB, exceeding one’s data plan and incurring additional charges becomes the norm rather than the exception for many consumers. Moreover, network performance varies significantly. While network performance may be great for some users in their specific location, it’s not for others. On top of that, if mobile users are moving, as is common, it’s likely they will experience variable network performance.

Where Battlestar flung viewers into the holocaust of all-out war against intelligent robot Cylons, Caprica narrates the chilling human events that led to the creatures’ creation — and mankind’s near destruction. Genius and hubris, in the form of industrialist Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) and his teenage daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Torresani), a gifted computer programmer, create the initial mechanism and provide the spark. Kindling comes in the form of Joseph Adama (Esai Morales), father of Willie (Sina Najafi), whom viewers know will grow up to become commander of Galactica . Viewers who know Battlestar ’s competing religious philosophies — the Colonials’ belief in many gods versus the Cylons’ belief in one — will not be surprised to learn that dogmatic conflict predates the Cylons themselves. The thematic strain of cultural oppression — humans over Cylons — that sparked the machines’ rebellion also existed in the Colonies before their destruction, in the form of Capricans over Taurons like Adama. As did the terrorist responses the humans later visited on their Cylon captors. Strong performances from Stoltz; Torresani; Morales; Magda Apanowicz as Zoe’s friend Lacy Rand; Paula Malcolmson as Zoe’s mom Amanda (who has a dramatic public epiphany) and Polly Walker (Atia from HBO’s Rome ) as the girls’ school headmistress, Sister Clarice, propel the action of life on Caprica before the deluge.",1.0,17,119,0.1

Choosing the best tech partners: Building a successful and profitable OTT company, and keeping up with the rapidly changing landscape of devices, players, formats, technologies and customer requirements, is enough of a challenge even to the most adventurous multitaskers. There’s no need to also take on every possible streaming service out there and copy, or try to re-invent, what others have already been doing successfully. Instead, find your niche and develop excellency and USPs, and select trustworthy, innovative vendors. At a time when reliable vendors were scarce, or those who existed did not have the toolsets  we needed, Lightcast.com  was forced to become CDN, a player developer, a social network developer, an encoding vendor, a sys admin company, and a live encoder manufacturer, as well as wear many other hats. Today, great tech companies have developed in our industry, with complimentary services to ours, and we quickly made decisions to integrate them and their tech seamlessly into the Media Cloud and give up further development of similar services of our own. For the most part, we still have our infrastructure, code, and software solutions that keep us flexible and independent, but instead of being spread thin by becoming a business of dozens of companies, we prefer to use the “best of the best” in each field, for each service, such as web players, DRM services, worldwide CDN infrastructure, or encoder manufacturing. This enables us to refine our core services and stay agile, fast and furiously passionate about our industry and tech partners.",0.0,8,119,0.4
