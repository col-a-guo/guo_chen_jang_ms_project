A video tag could only use a single, whole, web-hosted video file for its source. Once a page loaded, the browser began downloading that file, playing it back as it received more content. There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video. Seeking to a later point in the video is slow and tedious, requiring either additional server infrastructure or simply downloading the file up to the seek point.

Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it. To be sure, the more consumers that have 4K enabled TV sets, the more the demand for 4K services will grow.

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,0,127,0.2

The basic principle is simple: If you are inside the firewall and request something from the outside, your firewall allows the outside to send it to you. Internet video streaming is no exception; the viewer is in charge of requesting a stream from a streaming server once the request has been made from behind the firewall the server can then send the stream. With “circuitstyle” broadcast links the relationships are slightly more complicated. The “requestor” could be within the firewall at either endpoint, or in the “neutral ground” of the cloud. Control over the request flow is critical to working with the natural dynamics of a firewall rather than fighting with them at every location. ",1.0,0,127,0.1

Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.
