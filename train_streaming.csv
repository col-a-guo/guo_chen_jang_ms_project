But you can buy smaller quantities of what they make, as long as you can live with the functions they built in for the large cable TV operator.

I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.

The simplest way to define or understand ABR streaming is that a source or mezzanine stream is encoded at multiple bitrates. All of the different bitrate streams are segmented into chunks along with the creation of a manifest file. The reason for this is so that viewers can then download or stream the chunk that is best suited to their current bandwidth situation. The viewer can do this because they are made aware of all the available chunks at differing bit rates by the manifest file.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Many manufacturers outsource development of their codecs to a third party that specializes in that technology. In fact, the majority of encoders rely on codecs created by a single vendor. While this approach can be cost-effective, it necessarily entails ceding control over development to a third party and accepting that the codec will be fundamentally similar to many competing products."

The “field” on which anglers compete is the first challenge, as typically a BASSMASTER event is taking place on a 150-mile (or larger) river or lake. Going back to the 80s and 90s the events were videotaped, edited, and typically would air months after the event took place.  In the late 90s and early 00s, that time was cut down to two weeks to air with the advent of file-based editing, which simplified the workflow. Producing the event required significant resources on site, including a broadcast truck, camera operators, and production crew following the series of events around the country, whittling more than 100 hours of footage down to a 1 hour show."

While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

Cable companies have worked to implement authentication for TV Everywhere offerings, forcing a check of whether the viewer has a pay TV subscription before allowing the content to be viewed, but that could work to just further alienate entire generations who do not see the value in spending $50–$100 a month on pay TV when they can watch ad-supported or subscription-based VOD online.

In order to watch content created at 4K resolution, you need to have a TV, computer monitor, or projector that will display 3840x2160 pixels or higher. While CES 2014 showed off a huge crop of displays that will be available later this year, current choices are limited. All the major manufacturers have either launched a line of 4K-compatible displays or plan to launch one by 2Q. While several lesser-known brands such as Seiki and TCL are selling sub-$1,000 TVs and monitors, be sure to read the fine print. Some of the less-expensive models are using the old HDMI 1.4 standard, which only will allow 4K resolution at 30Hz, causing some issues with high-movement content such as action movies and gaming. Most higher-end laptops and PCs purchased within the past 6 months offer output support for 4K over HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort. Always check the specs to ensure you are getting true UHD quality."

With this approach, users can shed a great deal of the capital and operating expense associated with video processing and delivery. However, such platforms generally use a onesize-fits-all approach that may not work for many video providers. Often, every aspect of the workflow—from ingest to encoding, digital rights management to packaging, and content delivery network (CDN) to video player—is a proprietary solution developed by that same vendor, who may not have a core competency in each element of a comprehensive video workflow. Customers use only the vendor’s components, so sourcing best-of-breed technology for specific parts of the workflow is not an option. These solutions are often designed around a narrow set of use cases that work well for certain requirements and less so for others, and the ability to control or tune the platform to a provider’s unique needs is limited. This approach often does not include broadcast-grade features or the latest codecs, which leads to inefficiencies and limits video providers in their ability to deliver the viewing experiences their audiences have come to expect."
