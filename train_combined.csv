If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

Cablevision claims that Scripps is demanding three times more in fees for the networks that its old deal, amounting to about $20 million. Scripps has disputed that figure, saying that while it is asking for a higher rate increase for Food, its HGTV request is at the standard market rate.According to cable executives familiar with the negotiations, Scripps has landed deals with the National Cable Telecommunications Cooperative at the higher rate  http://www.multichannel.com/article/442736-Scripps_To_Broadcast_Iron_Chef_Dream_Home_Episodes_In_New_York.php and is close to a similar deal with Time Warner Cable. At the Citigroup conference, Scripps Networks chief financial officer Joe NeCastro said that most of its renewal negotiations are over.""We have accomplished what we set out to accomplish on the Food Network renewals, we had been looking looked for significant increase to bring it more in line with what we were being paid for HGTV, maybe a little bit better,"" NeCastro said. ""We were looking for a certain shape to the step-up curve. By all accounts, with one notable exception, we certainly have accomplished our goals.""According to SNL Kagan, Food had been getting about eight cents per subscriber per month while HGTV was getting about 13 cents.And while Scripps said it is working hard to get back to the negotiating table with Cablevision, the impact of being off the air for its 3.1 million metropolitan New York area customers has been minimal. Scripps still has coverage in the New York market through Time Warner cable, Comcast, DirecTV and Dish Network.NeCastro estimated that Cablevision customers represent about 2% of Scripps networks viewers and he pointed to the ratings of its Jan. 3 airing of Iron Chef America: Super Chef Battle, which was the most-watched episode in the Iron Chef's franchise history  http://www.multichannel.com/article/442653-Food_Fires_Up_Top_Viewing_Marks_With_Iron_Chef_Special_Worst_Cooks_Debut.php , even without Cablevision carriage.

I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint. And secondly, we have an architecture that doesn’t force you to buy layer 3 switches when you actually go and put a virtualized stack of hardware together to run the software. And that has great advantage, especially in geographies where power consumption — and certainly price — is very important. So think about parts of Europe, Latin America, certainly, all the developing countries — that is a huge advantage for us. So we feel very good about our position and in that space.",0.0,118,720,0.2

Other options to improve encoding densities and reduce power consumption include software encoding solutions that run on graphic processor units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

The message that starts that flow of information between the screen and the  subscription -TV service is the kind of thing that might use SOAP. Generally speaking, SOAP is one way to make a “legacy back office” component able to exchange information with a Web-based application. It’s a bridge from now to next. Likewise for SAML, which stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. SAML usually pops up in conversations about “TV Everywhere” and “the four anys.” That’s because it exists to solve the “single sign-on” conundrum: When you sign on as a subscriber to see an episode of Hot in Cleveland on TV Land, then leave that site, do some other stuff, and later go to Lifetime to watch an episode of Project Runway, chances are high that you’ll be irritated if you have to log in again. SAML relies on SOAP to run the messages of authentication (are you who you say you are) and authorization (do you subscribe to what you seek) back and forth. SOAP and SAML are both based on XML — Extensible Markup Language, the heavy lifter of the Internet. All of this must be ridiculously easy to implement, given how frequently the words “you just” front the Web’s acronym soup. An excerpt from a recent conversation with a Web smarty:“ You just do it as a Web service over a SOAP interface.” Now all we need is the ROPE. Then the SAML can send over the SOAP on a ROPE.

First, what percentage of rogue users now relying on shared credentials will convert to their own paid accounts? Second, what percentage of members will agree to a $7.99 surcharge to keep their friends/family members aboard? (Note that in this case, it’s possible there may be little impact on  Netflix ’s net subscriber total, but a bump in monthly spending per account, as existing members will now pay more.) Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in? Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.

The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.",1.0,118,720,0.2

Symonds said the group is talking to other potential investors, but would not reveal specifics. “We have some strong entities that have expressed interest in the channel and we’re making good progress,” he said. The 105 HBCU colleges and universities as a collective will also hold a 20% interest in the channel, Symonds added. The network expected to launch in August 2011 but may “soft-launch” in time for Black History Month next February, said Symonds. Symonds said the network is in talks with several “major” MSOs but would not reveal specific details. Representatives from Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Charter Communications and Comcast could not be reached for comment at press time. Symonds projects that the network will launch with 10 million subscribers — mostly through digital-basic and sportstier distribution. The network is proposing a 7.5 cents-per-subscriber license fee — well below the fees for similar national college sports-oriented networks like ESPNU (17 cents) or CBS College Sports (22 cents), or the more than $1 per subscriber charged by many regional sports networks. The network’s primary focus is to launch within the 20-state HBCU footprint encompassing the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern U.S., according to Evans, the network’s executive vice president of distribution and marketing. While the network’s key target demo is young adults 15 to 24, the network will also have appeal to HBCU alumni, sports fans and the multicultural and general- market student populations, according to Symonds. SPORTS-DRIVEN HBCU Net will focus primarily on sports programming, devoting the majority of its primetime and weekend schedules to live and repeat telecasts of college sports events, according to Walker, the startup’s executive vice president of programming. HBCU Network is expected to offer live NCAA Division I and Division II black college sports events from the four major HBCU Conferences — the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The network has worked out a deal with ESPN — which currently has multi-year rights to SWAC and MEAC college football games — to select conference games once the sports-programming giant has chosen its primary games for ESPNU. Beyond NBC’s deal to telecast the State Farm Bayou Classic college football game between HBCU schools Southern and Grambling State, Symonds says national rights to other HBCU-based athletic contests are up for grabs. “We are also working to lock up deals with the SIAC and the CIAA conferences,” he added. The network is also planning to create a daily SportsCenteresque HBCU sports studio show to run in the mornings, according to Walker.‘ENTERTAINMENT’ IN MIX While sports will serve as the staple of the network’s primetime programming fare, Walker said the rest of the schedule will feature acquired and originally produced lifestyle programming designed to capture the culture, heritage and lifestyle of the HBCU community, she said, without revealing specific programming titles. A major component of the schedule will also include “edutainment” programming — a mix of educationally- based and entertainment programming mostly aggregated from various colleges and universities, including guest lectures, celebrity speakers and on-campus entertainment performances, according to Walker. Symonds said the network will not in compete with BET or TV One for African-American viewers but rather will complement those services.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",0.0,118,720,0.3

The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded.
