Genius and hubris, in the form of industrialist Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) and his teenage daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Torresani), a gifted computer programmer, create the initial mechanism and provide the spark. Kindling comes in the form of Joseph Adama (Esai Morales), father of Willie (Sina Najafi), whom viewers know will grow up to become commander of Galactica .

The thematic strain of cultural oppression — humans over Cylons — that sparked the machines’ rebellion also existed in the Colonies before their destruction, in the form of Capricans over Taurons like Adama. As did the terrorist responses the humans later visited on their Cylon captors.

The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that.

The first is referred to as non-standalone architecture (NSA) as it involves adding 5G base stations onto already existing 4G core networks. With 5G NSA, Communication Service Providers (CSPs) can gradually roll out 5G services, starting with larger metropolitan areas. This initial stage already doubles available bandwidth, which in some cases means that a video transmitter can rely on a single 5G modem with the second on standby as a backup, while bonded 5G transmitters can offer the bandwidth needed for 4K UHD content.",0.0,0,98,0.2
