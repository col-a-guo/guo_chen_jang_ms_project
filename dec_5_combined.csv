Rarely does any one provider support streaming of content in Windows Media, Flash, QuickTime, and Real formats. While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

First, as shown in the Frame Size column of Table 7, not all mod-16 resolutions are a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio, forcing the compressionist to either crop pixels or adapt a non-16:9 aspect ratio, which distorts the video, however slightly.

But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.

SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,1,0.0,1.0,141,0.2

I said that WebRTC will be ready for prime time and that 2014 it would be part of the mainstream. Although slower Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently made waves in the media by asserting that linear TV will cease to exist by 2030. Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015. The downloaded application used for webconferencing heretofore will start to become a distant memory. The browser will be king in 2015. It will not only be WebRTC but also ORTC; Microsoft’s commitment to browser based communications. The online small work group collaboration business will continue to be turned on its head. Large webconferencing players will either begin or continue to offer free or freemium services; it will be a matter of survival. Look for the SMB market to be hardest hit as small companies tend to move quicker. In the SMB market unlike the large enterprise latest versions of Chrome and IE are readily available. SMB consumers are technically astute, flexible, and price conscious. Screen sharing, white boarding and collaboration will all be executed in the browser without the need for downloads or plug-ins; in many cases for free. Although terms like Turn, Ice and Stun are not household words yet in the larger enterprise they will be in the SMB. Economics drive behavior; free is tough to compete with.

Of course, VP9 isn’t the first codec that fails to efficiently leverage multiple- core systems, and encoding programs such as Tele stream Episode have long used a technique called split and stitch to improve performance on multiple-core systems. Much like YouTube’s parallel encoding schema, split and stitch divides a single input file into multiple parts encoded separately in parallel, and then stitched back together for final output.

The strongest drawback of building a DIY CDN or private CDN is the cost of the investment and the required know-how. Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors. The financial burden of those shifts into a service with a monthly fee that is often based on utilization and volume of the data. ",0.0,1,0.0,0.0,141,0.3

First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",0.0,1,0.0,0.0,141,0.2

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad. Those could be used to drive awareness or get the viewer to take an action, like visiting a site. ",0.0,1,0.0,0.0,141,0.4

Unlike a broadcast workflow, in which technologies are connected via  several standards, a streaming workflow is a hodgepodge of technologies stitched together through middleware and other custom code. In many cases, when streaming providers employ open source software within their operations, customizations may be responsible for one streaming component being able to communicate with another. And, of course, there are companies like Netflix, which has built a lot of its streaming infrastructure from the ground up. The kind of custom and proprietary technology development often necessary to enable streaming workflows is both a blessing and a curse. It  provides immense flexibility for streaming providers to design and build workflows that meet their specific requirements (product functionality, monetization mechanisms, etc.). But it can also expose the fragility of those workflows. Custom encoders can choke.
