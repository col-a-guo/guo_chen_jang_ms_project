For one, while everyone talks about cannibalization of eyeballs from the TV to the PC, little or no data supports it—at least not yet. Rights issues, while still key, are quickly being fixed with new contracts that start to address online content (remember that digital rights issues were a major part of the 2007 writers’ strike, and the cost of not managing these rights is apparent). And technology, while still a challenge in some respects, cannot be used as an excuse anymore. Advances in streaming technology, transcoding, HD, ad insertion, and localization mean fewer reasons to wait.
