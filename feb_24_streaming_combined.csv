If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

At high bandwidths, of course, quality is quite good, but if you’re paying for your H.264 bandwidth, you’ll want to choose a different encoder. Access to H.264 encoding features is also quite limited. ",1,5,1,0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,

While the process is not simple to understand, a complaint often lodged against the H.264 licensing process by competing codec solutions, it is much easier than trying to gather licenses from a large number of patent holders.  While the process of figuring out which areas are applicable might be tricky, the fees themselves are easily calculable, with the exception of a few questions we’ve noted throughout this document.

But their complaints are quickly being brushed aside in the face of overwhelming demand by an ever-growing number of users that are enthusiastically adopting the concept. Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

Multiplatinum rock band Incubus decided to ratchet that kind of connection up more than a few levels. For the week leading up to the release of its first new studio album in 5 years, the band and its crew turned a warehouse space in Los Angeles into a high-tech agora, where hundreds of aficionados chosen from its fan clubs converged to meet the band members, watch them rehearse and perform, participate with them on art projects using six large white canvases placed in the room and on instrument clinics, and just do an extended hang with their heroes.

There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos.

The strongest drawback of building a DIY CDN or private CDN is the cost of the investment and the required know-how. Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

Although the latency introduced by buffering makes little difference to the consumer experience of a drama delivered via VOD, the viewer watching live sports is now potentially tens of seconds behind the action compared to viewers over cable or satellite. In the modern, highly connected world, this means the prospect of sports fans hearing the cheers of neighbors watching live on satellite while their OTT streaming screens are still showing players arguing about the award of a penalty.

Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows.

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad. Those could be used to drive awareness or get the viewer to take an action, like visiting a site.

I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded.
