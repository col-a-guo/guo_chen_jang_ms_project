Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. The pay-asyou-go pricing model means that customers can scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and Nice People at Work directly into its own performance data and therefore provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain.

With “circuitstyle” broadcast links the relationships are slightly more complicated. The “requestor” could be within the firewall at either endpoint, or in the “neutral ground” of the cloud.

First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Zaslav said that, currently,  Discovery Health — which OWN is essentially taking over — gets minuscule carriage fees compared to other  Discovery networks (SNL Kagan estimates  Discovery Health gets an average of 12 cents per subscriber per month from distributors). That should change once Oprah takes control. “We think there is a meaningful opportunity if we can build a strong network with the Oprah brand and all the resources that we’re putting on it,” Zaslav said. “We’re bringing a lot of value to the cable industry — Oprah herself coming to cable is a big value. If we can build that, our position is that we should be able to get value over time. We are having discussions with distributors now, and those are ongoing.” Zaslav wouldn’t say what the network will ask for in carriage fees. Several reports have estimated OWN could attract between 40 cents and 50 cents per subscriber per month. Zaslav was also encouraged by what he characterized as a strong upfront market, which should drive increases in advertising. He added that ad revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, and guidance for the third quarter was for another increase of 13% or more. “We will be [up] more,” Zaslav said. The  Discovery CEO also had high praise for the ID: Investigation  Discovery network, which he said is the fastest growing network in the  Discovery Communications fold. And while he said that all of  Discovery ’s networks are profitable, FitTV and Military Channel may undergo some changes in the future, perhaps along the lines of its  Discovery Kids network, which in a joint venture with toymaker Hasbro will relaunch in October as The Hub. “Some of our channels, we are trying to figure out what’s the best use,” Zaslav said. “They are profitable today, and if we had our way we would build those channels ourselves. FitTV and Military are two of the channels that we’re trying to think of; for now they’re profi table but what could they be to have a bigger audience, a stronger brand, a bigger contribution? “We have been investing less in those channels as we look at our opportunities either with a joint venture opportunity, which we would only do if we thought that somebody brought something to the table that would make the channel significantly more valuable, like an Oprah or Hasbro.”",0.0,0,0.0,129.0,0.2

When it comes to providers, some support all of the formats, some support some of the formats, and some only one of the formats. Rarely does any one provider support streaming of content in Windows Media, Flash, QuickTime, and Real formats. While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so. Providers should be upfront and honest about what they support today and what they may support down the road.

By design, Elemental Cloud uses the same interface and application as Elemental’s appliance-based encoders. I reviewed the Elemental Server appliance previously (bit.ly/Ozer_elemental), and everything I wrote about the interface applies equally to Elemental Cloud. If you’re encoding with Elemental hardware, you can deploy the same presets and control the consolidated operation of the appliance and cloud from the same interface and/or API, which is an advantage no other cloud offering can match.",1.0,14,0.9950568462679189,88.0,0.2

A short list of supported devices—six certified Samsung smart TVs, PS4 Pro, select Amazon Fire TV devices, and select Android TV devices—published in The Verge seemingly contradicts that claim, as does the aforementioned lack of HDR support in Netflix’s current AV1 offering. There is an HDR10+ AV1 draft specification and talk of Dolby Vision support, but it’s tough to be king of the living room without fully implemented HDR support on a relevant critical mass of devices, which AV1 doesn’t currently seem to have.
