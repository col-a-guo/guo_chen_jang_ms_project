The message that starts that flow of information between the screen and the  subscription -TV service is the kind of thing that might use SOAP. Generally speaking, SOAP is one way to make a “legacy back office” component able to exchange information with a Web-based application. It’s a bridge from now to next. Likewise for SAML, which stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. SAML usually pops up in conversations about “TV Everywhere” and “the four anys.” That’s because it exists to solve the “single sign-on” conundrum: When you sign on as a subscriber to see an episode of Hot in Cleveland on TV Land, then leave that site, do some other stuff, and later go to Lifetime to watch an episode of Project Runway, chances are high that you’ll be irritated if you have to log in again. SAML relies on SOAP to run the messages of authentication (are you who you say you are) and authorization (do you subscribe to what you seek) back and forth. SOAP and SAML are both based on XML — Extensible Markup Language, the heavy lifter of the Internet. All of this must be ridiculously easy to implement, given how frequently the words “you just” front the Web’s acronym soup.

Symonds said the group is talking to other potential investors, but would not reveal specifics. “We have some strong entities that have expressed interest in the channel and we’re making good progress,” he said. The 105 HBCU colleges and universities as a collective will also hold a 20% interest in the channel, Symonds added. The network expected to launch in August 2011 but may “soft-launch” in time for Black History Month next February, said Symonds. Symonds said the network is in talks with several “major” MSOs but would not reveal specific details. Representatives from Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Charter Communications and Comcast could not be reached for comment at press time. Symonds projects that the network will launch with 10 million subscribers — mostly through digital-basic and sportstier distribution. The network is proposing a 7.5 cents-per-subscriber license fee — well below the fees for similar national college sports-oriented networks like ESPNU (17 cents) or CBS College Sports (22 cents), or the more than $1 per subscriber charged by many regional sports networks. The network’s primary focus is to launch within the 20-state HBCU footprint encompassing the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern U.S., according to Evans, the network’s executive vice president of distribution and marketing. While the network’s key target demo is young adults 15 to 24, the network will also have appeal to HBCU alumni, sports fans and the multicultural and general- market student populations, according to Symonds. SPORTS-DRIVEN HBCU Net will focus primarily on sports programming, devoting the majority of its primetime and weekend schedules to live and repeat telecasts of college sports events, according to Walker, the startup’s executive vice president of programming. HBCU Network is expected to offer live NCAA Division I and Division II black college sports events from the four major HBCU Conferences — the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The network has worked out a deal with ESPN — which currently has multi-year rights to SWAC and MEAC college football games — to select conference games once the sports-programming giant has chosen its primary games for ESPNU. Beyond NBC’s deal to telecast the State Farm Bayou Classic college football game between HBCU schools Southern and Grambling State, Symonds says national rights to other HBCU-based athletic contests are up for grabs. “We are also working to lock up deals with the SIAC and the CIAA conferences,” he added. The network is also planning to create a daily SportsCenteresque HBCU sports studio show to run in the mornings, according to Walker.‘ENTERTAINMENT’ IN MIX While sports will serve as the staple of the network’s primetime programming fare, Walker said the rest of the schedule will feature acquired and originally produced lifestyle programming designed to capture the culture, heritage and lifestyle of the HBCU community, she said, without revealing specific programming titles. A major component of the schedule will also include “edutainment” programming — a mix of educationally- based and entertainment programming mostly aggregated from various colleges and universities, including guest lectures, celebrity speakers and on-campus entertainment performances, according to Walker. Symonds said the network will not in compete with BET or TV One for African-American viewers but rather will complement those services. TV One president Johnathan Rodgers said he doesn’t see HBCU Network as a competitor, and in fact is in talks to handle the startup’s administrative, legal and operational functions.",1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

Zaslav said that, currently,  Discovery Health — which OWN is essentially taking over — gets minuscule carriage fees compared to other  Discovery networks (SNL Kagan estimates  Discovery Health gets an average of 12 cents per subscriber per month from distributors). That should change once Oprah takes control. “We think there is a meaningful opportunity if we can build a strong network with the Oprah brand and all the resources that we’re putting on it,” Zaslav said. “We’re bringing a lot of value to the cable industry — Oprah herself coming to cable is a big value. If we can build that, our position is that we should be able to get value over time. We are having discussions with distributors now, and those are ongoing.” Zaslav wouldn’t say what the network will ask for in carriage fees. Several reports have estimated OWN could attract between 40 cents and 50 cents per subscriber per month. Zaslav was also encouraged by what he characterized as a strong upfront market, which should drive increases in advertising. He added that ad revenue was up 13% in the second quarter, and guidance for the third quarter was for another increase of 13% or more. “We will be [up] more,” Zaslav said. The  Discovery CEO also had high praise for the ID: Investigation  Discovery network, which he said is the fastest growing network in the  Discovery Communications fold. And while he said that all of  Discovery ’s networks are profitable, FitTV and Military Channel may undergo some changes in the future, perhaps along the lines of its  Discovery Kids network, which in a joint venture with toymaker Hasbro will relaunch in October as The Hub. “Some of our channels, we are trying to figure out what’s the best use,” Zaslav said. “They are profitable today, and if we had our way we would build those channels ourselves. FitTV and Military are two of the channels that we’re trying to think of; for now they’re profi table but what could they be to have a bigger audience, a stronger brand, a bigger contribution? “We have been investing less in those channels as we look at our opportunities either with a joint venture opportunity, which we would only do if we thought that somebody brought something to the table that would make the channel significantly more valuable, like an Oprah or Hasbro.”",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in? Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.

I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint. And secondly, we have an architecture that doesn’t force you to buy layer 3 switches when you actually go and put a virtualized stack of hardware together to run the software. And that has great advantage, especially in geographies where power consumption — and certainly price — is very important. So think about parts of Europe, Latin America, certainly, all the developing countries — that is a huge advantage for us.
