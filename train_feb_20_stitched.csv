Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

I appreciated the ease of use for adding media and creating Presentations. Both the web UI and USB Fusion app were simple to use. I liked how information added to Presentations was automatically saved. Features that stood out to me were video playback, screencasting, and the ability to add webpages. I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded. For viewing the audio levels of sources, it would be helpful if there were wider VU meters to make it easier to see them. ",1.0,0,145,0.1

This might make their equipment more efficient and save 200 watts on one of their servers. Well done, very  green. However, if the impact of that change is that every device consuming the stream requires slightly more power to display the  pictures, overall, you have achieved the exact opposite of the local intention. If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size. The CDN cost savings alone are enough to make VOD catalogue owners evaluate the benefits of re-encoding their content libraries to take advantage of these new processes— especially now, when quality, price and speed are no longer obstacles.",0.0,0,145,0.2

These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

I said that WebRTC will be ready for prime time and that 2014 it would be part of the mainstream. Although slower Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently made waves in the media by asserting that linear TV will cease to exist by 2030. Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015. The downloaded application used for webconferencing heretofore will start to become a distant memory. The browser will be king in 2015. It will not only be WebRTC but also ORTC; Microsoft’s commitment to browser based communications. The online small work group collaboration business will continue to be turned on its head. Large webconferencing players will either begin or continue to offer free or freemium services; it will be a matter of survival. Look for the SMB market to be hardest hit as small companies tend to move quicker. In the SMB market unlike the large enterprise latest versions of Chrome and IE are readily available. SMB consumers are technically astute, flexible, and price conscious. Screen sharing, white boarding and collaboration will all be executed in the browser without the need for downloads or plug-ins; in many cases for free. Although terms like Turn, Ice and Stun are not household words yet in the larger enterprise they will be in the SMB. Economics drive behavior; free is tough to compete with.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",0.0,0,145,0.2

The device information contained in the distributed copy can be mapped to an individual illegally distributing the content (6) and can be used to hold them accountable by either denying future service or by initiating a criminal investigation as the extraction process yields the device/transaction ID.

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos.
