Where Battlestar flung viewers into the holocaust of all-out war against intelligent robot Cylons, Caprica narrates the chilling human events that led to the creatures’ creation — and mankind’s near destruction. Genius and hubris, in the form of industrialist Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) and his teenage daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Torresani), a gifted computer programmer, create the initial mechanism and provide the spark. Kindling comes in the form of Joseph Adama (Esai Morales), father of Willie (Sina Najafi), whom viewers know will grow up to become commander of Galactica . Viewers who know Battlestar ’s competing religious philosophies — the Colonials’ belief in many gods versus the Cylons’ belief in one — will not be surprised to learn that dogmatic conflict predates the Cylons themselves. The thematic strain of cultural oppression — humans over Cylons — that sparked the machines’ rebellion also existed in the Colonies before their destruction, in the form of Capricans over Taurons like Adama. As did the terrorist responses the humans later visited on their Cylon captors.

Symonds said the group is talking to other potential investors, but would not reveal specifics. “We have some strong entities that have expressed interest in the channel and we’re making good progress,” he said. The 105 HBCU colleges and universities as a collective will also hold a 20% interest in the channel, Symonds added. The network expected to launch in August 2011 but may “soft-launch” in time for Black History Month next February, said Symonds. Symonds said the network is in talks with several “major” MSOs but would not reveal specific details. Representatives from Time Warner Cable, Cox Communications, Charter Communications and Comcast could not be reached for comment at press time. Symonds projects that the network will launch with 10 million subscribers — mostly through digital-basic and sportstier distribution. The network is proposing a 7.5 cents-per-subscriber license fee — well below the fees for similar national college sports-oriented networks like ESPNU (17 cents) or CBS College Sports (22 cents), or the more than $1 per subscriber charged by many regional sports networks. The network’s primary focus is to launch within the 20-state HBCU footprint encompassing the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern U.S., according to Evans, the network’s executive vice president of distribution and marketing. While the network’s key target demo is young adults 15 to 24, the network will also have appeal to HBCU alumni, sports fans and the multicultural and general- market student populations, according to Symonds. SPORTS-DRIVEN HBCU Net will focus primarily on sports programming, devoting the majority of its primetime and weekend schedules to live and repeat telecasts of college sports events, according to Walker, the startup’s executive vice president of programming. HBCU Network is expected to offer live NCAA Division I and Division II black college sports events from the four major HBCU Conferences — the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, Southwestern Athletic Conference, Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The network has worked out a deal with ESPN — which currently has multi-year rights to SWAC and MEAC college football games — to select conference games once the sports-programming giant has chosen its primary games for ESPNU. Beyond NBC’s deal to telecast the State Farm Bayou Classic college football game between HBCU schools Southern and Grambling State, Symonds says national rights to other HBCU-based athletic contests are up for grabs. “We are also working to lock up deals with the SIAC and the CIAA conferences,” he added. The network is also planning to create a daily SportsCenteresque HBCU sports studio show to run in the mornings, according to Walker.‘ENTERTAINMENT’ IN MIX While sports will serve as the staple of the network’s primetime programming fare, Walker said the rest of the schedule will feature acquired and originally produced lifestyle programming designed to capture the culture, heritage and lifestyle of the HBCU community, she said, without revealing specific programming titles. A major component of the schedule will also include “edutainment” programming — a mix of educationally- based and entertainment programming mostly aggregated from various colleges and universities, including guest lectures, celebrity speakers and on-campus entertainment performances, according to Walker. Symonds said the network will not in compete with BET or TV One for African-American viewers but rather will complement those services. TV One president Johnathan Rodgers said he doesn’t see HBCU Network as a competitor, and in fact is in talks to handle the startup’s administrative, legal and operational functions.",0,1,0,"25,29",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,

And the tools that allow us to take that and do more of that. The idea is that we have savings goals with all of our clients. What we tell our clients, and one of the things that my team has been telling our clients for the last two years, is we need to pay more for impressions, but we should buy way fewer impressions. We need to make the impressions that we're buying, they’re going to cost more, more goes into it. They're going to look more expensive as an actual impression. But they’re going to generate far better results and we’re going to buy far fewer of them. And our clients are going to save money by reducing waste.

First, what percentage of rogue users now relying on shared credentials will convert to their own paid accounts? Second, what percentage of members will agree to a $7.99 surcharge to keep their friends/family members aboard? (Note that in this case, it’s possible there may be little impact on  Netflix ’s net subscriber total, but a bump in monthly spending per account, as existing members will now pay more.) Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in? Regarding the first option — converting shared password users to paying accounts — it’s likely the range of conversions will be high by direct-marketing standards.  Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations. Further, the cause is aided by the fact that  Netflix now offers an advertising-supported iteration for just $6.99 per month. As a result, the economic barrier to entry is lower than ever. It’s a good time to be vanquishing rogue passwords.",0,1,1,28,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0
