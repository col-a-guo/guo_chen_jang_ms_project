And technology, while still a challenge in some respects, cannot be used as an excuse anymore. Advances in streaming technology, transcoding, HD, ad insertion, and localization mean fewer reasons to wait.

That was true in 2001, and it is still the case. The expectation stems from con- sumer price points for cable TV STBs that are not only purchased in 100,000 unit volume by the cable TV operators but are subsidized by recurring cable TV revenues and service con- tract periods. Unless you are buying by the pallet-load, the STB manufacturers generally won’t talk to you. But you can buy smaller quantities of what they make, as long as you can live with the functions they built in for the large cable TV operator. You can’t expect the STB to behave like a PC or browser, nor should you—it is designed to operate with an infrared remote control, and every STB handles the keycodes differently.

In adaptive streaming, each video file contains multiple streams encoded at different bitrates and resolutions; in the case of the video shown above in Figure 4, the adaptive bitrate stream would include both the high bitrate stream and the low bitrate version—as well as streams at other bitrates and resolutions in between—and adjusts what bitrate is actually delivered to the viewing device based on the speed of the network connection (Figure 9). If you’re watching an adaptive bitrate stream on your smart TV and you have the bandwidth available, you’ll get the highest bitrate—and highest quality—to watch.

I liked how information added to Presentations was automatically saved. Features that stood out to me were video playback, screencasting, and the ability to add webpages. I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded. For viewing the audio levels of sources, it would be helpful if there were wider VU meters to make it easier to see them.
