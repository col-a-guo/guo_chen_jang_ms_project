All of the different bitrate streams are segmented into chunks along with the creation of a manifest file. The reason for this is so that viewers can then download or stream the chunk that is best suited to their current bandwidth situation. The viewer can do this because they are made aware of all the available chunks at differing bit rates by the manifest file.,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,
