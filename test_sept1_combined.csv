Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,5,0.4375,133,0.2

This would be the broken, infl exible and costly cable business model grafted onto the Internet, happening at a time when the big  video bundle is already crumbling.

The skill of Mediasite is to transform the act of communicating into knowledge in a single step.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size. The CDN cost savings alone are enough to make VOD catalogue owners evaluate the benefits of re-encoding their content libraries to take advantage of these new processes— especially now, when quality, price and speed are no longer obstacles.",0.0,0,0.75,133,0.3

Rarely does any one provider support streaming of content in Windows Media, Flash, QuickTime, and Real formats. While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

Then, in the rarest of occurrences, the companies reversed course and converged toward a single standard, which almost certainly helped shove HEVC back on its intended path.

This might make their equipment more efficient and save 200 watts on one of their servers. Well done, very  green. However, if the impact of that change is that every device consuming the stream requires slightly more power to display the  pictures, overall, you have achieved the exact opposite of the local intention. If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

The major players in the industry are now at various stages in the process of implementing VAST. “In 2009, you can expect to start seeing a great deal of interoperability,” says Paparo, principal author of the VAST document. “That will reduce transaction costs, not just for agencies, but also for publishers.” ",1.0,20,0.125,114,0.3

For example, in my tests, I configured the 1080p LCEVC stream with a 960x540x265 base layer and an LCEVC layer expanding the output to 1080p.
