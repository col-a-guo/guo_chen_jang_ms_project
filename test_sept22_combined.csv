For example, in Figure 16, the Laptop location profile is sent first to the 2k3-Edge1-Acc Media server, with failover to the AMMS—Acc Media server.

I appreciated the ease of use for adding media and creating Presentations. Both the web UI and USB Fusion app were simple to use. I liked how information added to Presentations was automatically saved. Features that stood out to me were video playback, screencasting, and the ability to add webpages. I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded. For viewing the audio levels of sources, it would be helpful if there were wider VU meters to make it easier to see them. ",1.0,0,1.0,133,0.1

Where Battlestar flung viewers into the holocaust of all-out war against intelligent robot Cylons, Caprica narrates the chilling human events that led to the creatures’ creation — and mankind’s near destruction. Genius and hubris, in the form of industrialist Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) and his teenage daughter, Zoe (Alessandra Torresani), a gifted computer programmer, create the initial mechanism and provide the spark. Kindling comes in the form of Joseph Adama (Esai Morales), father of Willie (Sina Najafi), whom viewers know will grow up to become commander of Galactica . Viewers who know Battlestar ’s competing religious philosophies — the Colonials’ belief in many gods versus the Cylons’ belief in one — will not be surprised to learn that dogmatic conflict predates the Cylons themselves. The thematic strain of cultural oppression — humans over Cylons — that sparked the machines’ rebellion also existed in the Colonies before their destruction, in the form of Capricans over Taurons like Adama.

This might make their equipment more efficient and save 200 watts on one of their servers. Well done, very  green. However, if the impact of that change is that every device consuming the stream requires slightly more power to display the  pictures, overall, you have achieved the exact opposite of the local intention. If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size. The CDN cost savings alone are enough to make VOD catalogue owners evaluate the benefits of re-encoding their content libraries to take advantage of these new processes— especially now, when quality, price and speed are no longer obstacles.",0.0,0,0.75,133,0.3

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

In fact, LCEVC has already been implemented by many streaming producers as V-Nova’s P+ codec.

Likewise for SAML, which stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. SAML usually pops up in conversations about “TV Everywhere” and “the four anys.” That’s because it exists to solve the “single sign-on” conundrum: When you sign on as a subscriber to see an episode of Hot in Cleveland on TV Land, then leave that site, do some other stuff, and later go to Lifetime to watch an episode of Project Runway, chances are high that you’ll be irritated if you have to log in again. SAML relies on SOAP to run the messages of authentication (are you who you say you are) and authorization (do you subscribe to what you seek) back and forth. SOAP and SAML are both based on XML — Extensible Markup Language, the heavy lifter of the Internet. All of this must be ridiculously easy to implement, given how frequently the words “you just” front the Web’s acronym soup.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,5,0.4375,133,0.2

If each of a million TVs (each of which probably consumes around 200 watts individually) uses a few watts more, suddenly, your ‘green’ initiative is responsible  for upping overall power consumption by several megawatts.

These higher speeds improve the streaming experience, which in turn drives demand for more content, but watching all of that video on a smartphone comes at a cost. The average data plan for a U.S. cellular customer is 2.5GB per month, with most of that data being used for video. Considering that streaming one hour of HD video on Netflix can consume as much as 3GB, exceeding one’s data plan and incurring additional charges becomes the norm rather than the exception for many consumers. Moreover, network performance varies significantly. While network performance may be great for some users in their specific location, it’s not for others. On top of that, if mobile users are moving, as is common, it’s likely they will experience variable network performance.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,5,0.4375,133,0.2

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.

And, of course, there are companies like Netflix, which has built a lot of its streaming infrastructure from the ground up. The kind of custom and proprietary technology development often necessary to enable streaming workflows is both a blessing and a curse. It  provides immense flexibility for streaming providers to design and build workflows that meet their specific requirements (product functionality, monetization mechanisms, etc.).
