With “circuitstyle” broadcast links the relationships are slightly more complicated. The “requestor” could be within the firewall at either endpoint, or in the “neutral ground” of the cloud.

Third, what percentage of members will either disconnect altogether as a form of protest, as the research firms OnePoll and Samba warned, or will simply stop allowing others to log in?

They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.

Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units.

Variations on this architecture include cloud-native software that can be deployed on virtualized or containerized instances in the cloud or enterprise data centers.  While software encoding on CPU is your most flexible option, it is also likely your most expensive option requiring the most servers, rackspace, power, and cooling, making this encoding strategy undesirable, if not impractical, for edge data center environments. Other options to improve encoding densities and reduce power consumption include software encoding solutions that run on graphic processor units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, to achieve the density and low power targets of edge data center environments, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) encoding solutions are your best option. ",0.0,0,0.75,132,0.3

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,5,0.4375,132,0.2

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. The pay-asyou-go pricing model means that customers can scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",1.0,0,0.75,132,0.2

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",0.0,0,0.75,132,0.2

Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. The pay-asyou-go pricing model means that customers can scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and Nice People at Work directly into its own performance data and therefore provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain.

But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.

Rarely does any one provider support streaming of content in Windows Media, Flash, QuickTime, and Real formats. While it may seem odd that they don’t support all of the formats, there may be a logical explanation. If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so. Providers should be upfront and honest about what they support today and what they may support down the road.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",0.0,5,0.4375,132,0.2

Now multiply this by hundreds of channels and you can see the importance of an easily scalable solution for multiscreen live linear streaming. As we pointed out in the first question, relying on traditional hardware encoders where one source equals one input—even with newer high density encoders—you will quickly have to purchase and maintain racks and racks of new encoders to keep hundreds of channels streaming. This is why many content providers are looking for more flexible solutions. Using a cloud-based video workflow service to launch new streaming channels can be done quickly, since the hardware is already provisioned and ready to go.",1.0,14,0.375,132,0.2

Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it.

Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015.

Cablevision claims that Scripps is demanding three times more in fees for the networks that its old deal, amounting to about $20 million. Scripps has disputed that figure, saying that while it is asking for a higher rate increase for Food, its HGTV request is at the standard market rate.According to cable executives familiar with the negotiations, Scripps has landed deals with the National Cable Telecommunications Cooperative at the higher rate  http://www.multichannel.com/article/442736-Scripps_To_Broadcast_Iron_Chef_Dream_Home_Episodes_In_New_York.php and is close to a similar deal with Time Warner Cable. At the Citigroup conference, Scripps Networks chief financial officer Joe NeCastro said that most of its renewal negotiations are over.""We have accomplished what we set out to accomplish on the Food Network renewals, we had been looking looked for significant increase to bring it more in line with what we were being paid for HGTV, maybe a little bit better,"" NeCastro said. ""We were looking for a certain shape to the step-up curve. By all accounts, with one notable exception, we certainly have accomplished our goals.""According to SNL Kagan, Food had been getting about eight cents per subscriber per month while HGTV was getting about 13 cents.And while Scripps said it is working hard to get back to the negotiating table with Cablevision, the impact of being off the air for its 3.1 million metropolitan New York area customers has been minimal. Scripps still has coverage in the New York market through Time Warner cable, Comcast, DirecTV and Dish Network.NeCastro estimated that Cablevision customers represent about 2% of Scripps networks viewers and he pointed to the ratings of its Jan. 3 airing of Iron Chef America: Super Chef Battle, which was the most-watched episode in the Iron Chef's franchise history  http://www.multichannel.com/article/442653-Food_Fires_Up_Top_Viewing_Marks_With_Iron_Chef_Special_Worst_Cooks_Debut.php , even without Cablevision carriage.
