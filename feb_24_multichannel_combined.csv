Netflix has a keen advantage in that these users don’t have to be “sold” on the product. They’re already familiar at a level of intimacy, many of them maintaining unique identities, viewing histories and personalized  content recommendations.

0.5,2023,None,None,None,"MG: I see it similarly. There are only two vendors today that have demonstrated a virtualized CMTS, or virtualized core: Harmonic and Casa. I think CommScope has now announced that they have one, but they haven't delivered it yet. Harmonic did a nice job of going to Comcast and structuring a very interesting deal, which had to do with sharing of intellectual property and ownership and all kinds of other things. That put them on the map with not only the largest cable provider in the world but also one that is at the forefront of pushing things like DOCSIS [4.0] and high-speed services. So, that absolutely is their heritage. But we have done a very nice job of competing against them and winning. We’ve gone up against Harmonic for many carriers around the world, some of which have been announced publicly. And the reason is really twofold. The first is that we had the benefit of having a real CMTS. We took the code off of that fully functional CMTS and moved it into a virtualized and cloud-native environment. Harmonic built it from the ground up. There’s nothing wrong with that, but you do get advantages when you actually have a fully functioning system, especially from an operations provisioning and support standpoint. And secondly, we have an architecture that doesn’t force you to buy layer 3 switches when you actually go and put a virtualized stack of hardware together to run the software. And that has great advantage, especially in geographies where power consumption — and certainly price — is very important. So think about parts of Europe, Latin America, certainly, all the developing countries — that is a huge advantage for us. So we feel very good about our position and in that space.",1,"11,14",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
