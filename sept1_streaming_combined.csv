First, ProCoder has issues with multi-pass H.264 encoding when encoding within the ProCoder program. Specifically, if you set up a batch routine that includes multi-pass H.264 encoding, ProCoder will encode only the QuickTime files and none of the others in the queue. You can work around this issue by encoding in Job Queue Manager or via a watch folder, but not within ProCoder itself. In addition, the Job Queue Manager frequently displayed an unspecified error when encoding multi-pass H.264 files, so I used single-pass encoding for all performance tests and encoded files for quality-related tests one at a time.

If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

Conversely, as the file size increases, this overhead (as a percentage of download time) is minimized and the more efficient a peer system becomes.",0.0,1.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

It’s the modern-day equivalent of a display ad in the Yellow Pages, but video provides a better opportunity for demonstrating how a product or service works. Another use case is for direct video emails and SMS. Limelight customer Imavex offers targeted marketing services and now includes video in its online STREAMOTOR service. STREAMOTOR became popular initially with a number of car dealerships, which use the service to send mobile video both to existing and prospective customers. A mobile video acts like a video voicemail that a consumer can access at any time. Sending a video birthday message to a loyal customer strengthens that relationship.

One treats nonmod-16 streams like “ring around the collar,” evidencing a total lack of sophistication on the part of the compressionist. However, there are some very relevant arguments against the importance of mod-16. First, as shown in the Frame Size column of Table 7, not all mod-16 resolutions are a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio, forcing the compressionist to either crop pixels or adapt a non-16:9 aspect ratio, which distorts the video, however slightly. Second, the extra pixels are always at the edges, so the encoder can apply less data to these blocks without a noticeable loss in quality.

Most of what takes place once the signals reach the encoder farms tends to be automatic—the result of plenty of programming ahead of time—as is distribution to the various carriers. But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos.

Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video.

Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015.

Of course, VP9 isn’t the first codec that fails to efficiently leverage multiple- core systems, and encoding programs such as Tele stream Episode have long used a technique called split and stitch to improve performance on multiple-core systems. Much like YouTube’s parallel encoding schema, split and stitch divides a single input file into multiple parts encoded separately in parallel, and then stitched back together for final output.

Going back to the 80s and 90s the events were videotaped, edited, and typically would air months after the event took place.  In the late 90s and early 00s, that time was cut down to two weeks to air with the advent of file-based editing, which simplified the workflow. Producing the event required significant resources on site, including a broadcast truck, camera operators, and production crew following the series of events around the country, whittling more than 100 hours of footage down to a 1 hour show.",0.0,1.0,0,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In MPEG-speak, it’s a standard for segmented media delivery formalized as MPEG-A Part 19, or ISO/IEC 23000-19. Specifically, CMAF uses the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF) container—with common encryption (CENC); support for H.264, HEVC, and other codecs; and WebVTT and IMSC-1 captioning. For compatibility, CMAF can be called by both HLS playlists (.m3u8 files) and DASH manifest files (.mpd files). For HLS delivery, CMAF will replace files currently packaged in the MPEG-2 container format. For DASH, CMAF will mean a very minor change to the existing ISOBMFF-based format.

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

If it takes the content distributor a day to perform the transcoding, and then even more time for quality control (QC), they may lose a substantial percentage of VOD customers to their competition. Ideally once a network secures a new piece of media from a content owner, they want the file transcoded, QC’d and available for customers on demand as soon as possible, within hours not weeks. Accelerated transcoding is a very real solution which solves these complex compute heavy workflows. Not only is the transcode sped up by an order of magnitude, but thanks to a combination of new encoding technologies like quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR), one transcode job can produce the whole ABR stack of 60-70 different deliverables with up to a 50% reduction of file size.

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

When there are a few hundred people watching, live video delivery can be quite easy; when there are more than a million people watching, it becomes much harder. And as that audience grows, expectations grow, too: Today, viewers watching an over-the-top (OTT) live stream believe that it should be as good as—if not better than— traditional broadcast. Ten or 15 years ago, it might have been understood that the online version of a live stream was the “besteffort” and audience expectations would reflect that.

Unlike a broadcast workflow, in which technologies are connected via  several standards, a streaming workflow is a hodgepodge of technologies stitched together through middleware and other custom code. In many cases, when streaming providers employ open source software within their operations, customizations may be responsible for one streaming component being able to communicate with another. And, of course, there are companies like Netflix, which has built a lot of its streaming infrastructure from the ground up. The kind of custom and proprietary technology development often necessary to enable streaming workflows is both a blessing and a curse. It  provides immense flexibility for streaming providers to design and build workflows that meet their specific requirements (product functionality, monetization mechanisms, etc.).

I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded.

Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so.

Though the overall score is high, the critical mistakes——in choosing a background, codec selection, and encoding techniques——are so fundamental that they unnecessarily degrade the quality of the entire production.

But their complaints are quickly being brushed aside in the face of overwhelming demand by an ever-growing number of users that are enthusiastically adopting the concept. Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

Among Limelight Networks customers, one popular scenario is for enhanced directory listings. It’s the modern-day equivalent of a display ad in the Yellow Pages, but video provides a better opportunity for demonstrating how a product or service works. Another use case is for direct video emails and SMS. Limelight customer Imavex offers targeted marketing services and now includes video in its online STREAMOTOR service. STREAMOTOR became popular initially with a number of car dealerships, which use the service to send mobile video both to existing and prospective customers. A mobile video acts like a video voicemail that a consumer can access at any time. Sending a video birthday message to a loyal customer strengthens that relationship. Likewise, sending a follow-up video after a customer test-drives a new car adds a personal touch that can make the difference between a purchase and a lost opportunity.",,1.0,"19, 20",0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One treats nonmod-16 streams like “ring around the collar,” evidencing a total lack of sophistication on the part of the compressionist. However, there are some very relevant arguments against the importance of mod-16. First, as shown in the Frame Size column of Table 7, not all mod-16 resolutions are a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio, forcing the compressionist to either crop pixels or adapt a non-16:9 aspect ratio, which distorts the video, however slightly. Second, the extra pixels are always at the edges, so the encoder can apply less data to these blocks without a noticeable loss in quality.

Most of what takes place once the signals reach the encoder farms tends to be automatic—the result of plenty of programming ahead of time—as is distribution to the various carriers. But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.

For example, in Figure 16, the Laptop location profile is sent first to the 2k3-Edge1-Acc Media server, with failover to the AMMS—Acc Media server.

Multiplatinum rock band Incubus decided to ratchet that kind of connection up more than a few levels. For the week leading up to the release of its first new studio album in 5 years, the band and its crew turned a warehouse space in Los Angeles into a high-tech agora, where hundreds of aficionados chosen from its fan clubs converged to meet the band members, watch them rehearse and perform, participate with them on art projects using six large white canvases placed in the room and on instrument clinics, and just do an extended hang with their heroes.

HTML5 video is kind of like me at 6 years old. It has the potential to some day be a fully functioning HTML tag. But right now, it has some issues. In order to work with HTML5, we need to know what its issues are and how to patch them. That said, HTML5 video will some day be the default method developers use for playing video on the web. Apple is holding strong on its decision not to support Flash on iOS, Adobe is cutting development on Flash for other mobile browsers, and more users support HTML5 video every day as Chrome takes over the browser market. That makes this a great time to get a head start on building video experiences with HTML5 video.",,1.0,12,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2).

A video tag could only use a single, whole, web-hosted video file for its source. Once a page loaded, the browser began downloading that file, playing it back as it received more content. There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video.

The bigger issue is the connection from the operator to the internet, and an alternative APN provider can really help you address this issue.

I said that WebRTC will be ready for prime time and that 2014 it would be part of the mainstream. Although slower Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently made waves in the media by asserting that linear TV will cease to exist by 2030. Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015. The downloaded application used for webconferencing heretofore will start to become a distant memory. The browser will be king in 2015. It will not only be WebRTC but also ORTC; Microsoft’s commitment to browser based communications. The online small work group collaboration business will continue to be turned on its head. Large webconferencing players will either begin or continue to offer free or freemium services; it will be a matter of survival. Look for the SMB market to be hardest hit as small companies tend to move quicker. In the SMB market unlike the large enterprise latest versions of Chrome and IE are readily available. SMB consumers are technically astute, flexible, and price conscious. Screen sharing, white boarding and collaboration will all be executed in the browser without the need for downloads or plug-ins; in many cases for free. Although terms like Turn, Ice and Stun are not household words yet in the larger enterprise they will be in the SMB. Economics drive behavior; free is tough to compete with.

Media companies and studios are increasingly offering enough available content to launch a service, and consumers are beginning to show a demand for it.

However, if you’re in the business of live streaming, video chats in desktop browsers, and/or legacy browsers, your dependency on the Flash plug-in won’t be a thing of the past until browser vendors adopt a ubiquitous real-time specification.

Data download speeds for mobile users have improved by more than 30 percent since 2015, now attaining an average of 19.27Mbps, according to Speedtest. These higher speeds improve the streaming experience, which in turn drives demand for more content, but watching all of that video on a smartphone comes at a cost. The average data plan for a U.S. cellular customer is 2.5GB per month, with most of that data being used for video. Considering that streaming one hour of HD video on Netflix can consume as much as 3GB, exceeding one’s data plan and incurring additional charges becomes the norm rather than the exception for many consumers. Moreover, network performance varies significantly. While network performance may be great for some users in their specific location, it’s not for others. On top of that, if mobile users are moving, as is common, it’s likely they will experience variable network performance.

Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors.

Variations on this architecture include cloud-native software that can be deployed on virtualized or containerized instances in the cloud or enterprise data centers.  While software encoding on CPU is your most flexible option, it is also likely your most expensive option requiring the most servers, rackspace, power, and cooling, making this encoding strategy undesirable, if not impractical, for edge data center environments. Other options to improve encoding densities and reduce power consumption include software encoding solutions that run on graphic processor units (GPUs) or field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). However, to achieve the density and low power targets of edge data center environments, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) encoding solutions are your best option.

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad.

Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",,1.0,0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions.

If a provider is only going after a specific vertical or industry, for instance the webcasting space, chances are they don’t yet support Flash Video, since the Flash Video platform is not yet used frequently for live streaming delivery. Or a provider may not support a particular format because the format provider will not allow them to unless they are certified and licensed to do so. Providers should be upfront and honest about what they support today and what they may support down the road. On Microsoft’s and Adobe’s websites, you can see who is certified to provide delivery services in both of their formats.

Although companies such as TV Worldwide have been doing live webcasts for more than 10 years, for many people, it’s a brand-new technology. That means that if anything goes wrong in a webcast, the obvious party to point the finger at is the one with the newest technology. If there are problems that will seriously impact the quality of the live webcast, the client needs to understand that going in. If it goes well, the webcaster usually ends up getting the credit.

But their complaints are quickly being brushed aside in the face of overwhelming demand by an ever-growing number of users that are enthusiastically adopting the concept. Similar warnings were voiced years ago when desktop publishing first became available, shortly followed by desktop presentation creation tools such as Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft PowerPoint. Professional graphics designers identified early challenges: “There are ten typefaces per page” and “These are unreadable slides—they’re not created by artists.” While they had a point—there is no substitute for good design—the reality was that “business-based” end users became increasingly adept, and the applications became pervasive. As a result, internal business typesetting and presentation production is now the norm. So to video professionals blocking EGC we say, “It’s better to join now because there’s no turning back.

Though the overall score is high, the critical mistakes——in choosing a background, codec selection, and encoding techniques——are so fundamental that they unnecessarily degrade the quality of the entire production.

One treats nonmod-16 streams like “ring around the collar,” evidencing a total lack of sophistication on the part of the compressionist. However, there are some very relevant arguments against the importance of mod-16. First, as shown in the Frame Size column of Table 7, not all mod-16 resolutions are a perfect 16:9 aspect ratio, forcing the compressionist to either crop pixels or adapt a non-16:9 aspect ratio, which distorts the video, however slightly. Second, the extra pixels are always at the edges, so the encoder can apply less data to these blocks without a noticeable loss in quality.

Most of what takes place once the signals reach the encoder farms tends to be automatic—the result of plenty of programming ahead of time—as is distribution to the various carriers. But Sahara says there’s still a lot of management that has to go on. The diversity of handset profiles in the market is in contrast to broadcast sports in general, which are now shown almost universally in high definition at the major-network level. In some cases, each phone type might have multiple bitrate streams, if the carrier supports that. The best solution is to start with the highest quality signals possible. “Even if it’s on a 160x240 [resolution] handset screen, for instance, the quality is better if the source material is high-quality,” he says.

For the week leading up to the release of its first new studio album in 5 years, the band and its crew turned a warehouse space in Los Angeles into a high-tech agora, where hundreds of aficionados chosen from its fan clubs converged to meet the band members, watch them rehearse and perform, participate with them on art projects using six large white canvases placed in the room and on instrument clinics, and just do an extended hang with their heroes.

These operators allow you to authorize on their APN, and since these providers offer a boutique service to broadcasters, their APNs are often directly peered to the target broadcaster’s network, or at least their ISP, and have limits on the number of users. While this doesn’t help the issue of backhaul contention between the cellmux and the operator (via the tower and its fiber back to the network core) this capacity is often quite abundant.

There are some drawbacks to progressive download. Progressive download cannot dynamically increase or decrease the quality based on what the user’s browser can handle (known as adaptive bitrate or ABR). Once a video has completely downloaded,  the entire file is in the browser’s cache, which means users can redistribute the video.

Prediction of encoding parameters is required to efficiently encode such streams. Often these kind of streams are of sports events or live performances that require fast frame rates. Bitrates can fluctuate depending on the incoming frame characteristics. RiverSilica’s PIXABIT™ controls and regulates the bit rate of encoded streams. The psychovisual quality control module in PIXABIT™ spends bits by intelligently monitoring the texture of the video. Characteristics such as scene change, fade effect, dissolve effect, complete black frame, complete white frame, and normal frame are monitored. SAND™ computes the values for these parameters and passes them on to PIXABIT™ for modelling. PIXABIT™ applies stochastic processes on parameter distributions to predict the next frame parameters. Any variation in the actual parameters from predicted values is fed back into the PIXABIT™ module to fine tune the bitrate dynamically. In our labs, a fastmoving, 20-second “touchdown” video was encoded at 3Mbps and the bitrate of the output was measured every second. On an average, 2.972Mbps was achieved with a -0.93% variation (Figure 2). With such tight control over bitrate, PIXABIT™ is well-suited for live video transcoding environments where network bandwidth provisioning is of prime importance. Infrastructure providers can now plan to have to use less extra bandwidth to handle bitrate variations for live videos. Likewise, for consumers, constant bitrate will ensure that their data usage is predictable.",,1.0,5,1.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I said that WebRTC will be ready for prime time and that 2014 it would be part of the mainstream. Although slower Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recently made waves in the media by asserting that linear TV will cease to exist by 2030. Just a few years ago, that claim would have been met with a lot of skepticism, but in light of  recent developments (e.g. HBO offering a stand-alone OTT  service), it no longer seems as far-fetched.   to gain traction than I predicted I am doubling down in 2015. The downloaded application used for webconferencing heretofore will start to become a distant memory. The browser will be king in 2015. It will not only be WebRTC but also ORTC; Microsoft’s commitment to browser based communications. The online small work group collaboration business will continue to be turned on its head. Large webconferencing players will either begin or continue to offer free or freemium services; it will be a matter of survival. Look for the SMB market to be hardest hit as small companies tend to move quicker. In the SMB market unlike the large enterprise latest versions of Chrome and IE are readily available. SMB consumers are technically astute, flexible, and price conscious. Screen sharing, white boarding and collaboration will all be executed in the browser without the need for downloads or plug-ins; in many cases for free. Although terms like Turn, Ice and Stun are not household words yet in the larger enterprise they will be in the SMB. Economics drive behavior; free is tough to compete with. Watch the technology titans in webconferencing fight over free in the SMB; the enterprise is soon to come.

In MPEG-speak, it’s a standard for segmented media delivery formalized as MPEG-A Part 19, or ISO/IEC 23000-19. Specifically, CMAF uses the ISO Base Media File Format (ISOBMFF) container—with common encryption (CENC); support for H.264, HEVC, and other codecs; and WebVTT and IMSC-1 captioning. For compatibility, CMAF can be called by both HLS playlists (.m3u8 files) and DASH manifest files (.mpd files). For HLS delivery, CMAF will replace files currently packaged in the MPEG-2 container format. For DASH, CMAF will mean a very minor change to the existing ISOBMFF-based format.

Even though many complained about the poor quality, live streaming was about to be catapulted into the stratosphere. Later that year, another large-scale live event, Net Aid, brought even more exposure to the streaming media industry when Cisco pooled together many vendors in the market to bring the event to a worldwide audience.

Heck, at 40.5 seconds per file, it’s only about 10% percent slower than H.264. However, this performance schema puts the burden on the developer to create an efficient encoding program or platform. Of course, VP9 isn’t the first codec that fails to efficiently leverage multiple- core systems, and encoding programs such as Tele stream Episode have long used a technique called split and stitch to improve performance on multiple-core systems. Much like YouTube’s parallel encoding schema, split and stitch divides a single input file into multiple parts encoded separately in parallel, and then stitched back together for final output. Essentially, the 12-simultaneous encode test shown in Table 1 simulates this parallel encoding operation, which pushed the Z840 to 98%+ utilization (Figure 3).

The strongest drawback of building a DIY CDN or private CDN is the cost of the investment and the required know-how. Server costs, network costs, maintenance, upgrades, and support all add up to major investment costs. These costs, lack of know-how, and risk of losing business focus create the main reason for many OTT companies to move towards cloud CDNs or combine those two and have a strong hybrid CDN.  In order to use cloud CDN, an agreement with a third-party CDN provider is necessary. Through this agreement, the corporation outsources a great deal of its operational cost while also encountering some visibility and control limitations. In this model, most of the cost including maintenance, upgrading, support, servers, and system management are paid by the third-party CDN provider and the corporation avoids the capital expense, time demands, and stress of these factors. The financial burden of those shifts into a service with a monthly fee that is often based on utilization and volume of the data.

But how does this make money? It’s not something viewers would pay for. No, but businesses would. Vizbee is purely B2B, and it helps businesses in multiple ways. First, when viewers discover content on their phone and cast it to their TV, they’ll watch longer, so more ads are viewed. Second, if viewers want to cast a publisher’s video to their TV but don’t have that publisher’s app installed, Vizbee will initiate an app download, which helps the publisher get on more devices. Third, the app offers new content recommendations, which keeps viewers coming back and watching more. It also bridges the publisher’s marketing channels— which push content to web and mobile—to the TV. And fourth, it lets the publisher sell more interesting ad units. Because the phone and TV are in sync, the publisher can sell mobile companion ads that interact with the TV ad. Those could be used to drive awareness or get the viewer to take an action, like visiting a site.

Using this set of cloud services, users can dynamically spin up monitoring projects with real-time video QoE analysis and a comprehensive view of CDN delivery network QoS performance. Post-origin QoE measurements enable customer experience validation after ABR packaging. These new capabilities allow users to easily correlate error events with streaming and media quality metrics. A pay-as-you-go pricing model allows organizations to scale their monitoring environment on demand, and even “swarm” a particular problem stream or availability zone with monitoring points to quickly pinpoint the source of the problem, then take the swarm down when the task is complete—all while only paying for the system for the time it’s active. Recognizing the value of client-side analytics, OptiQ can also integrate data from companies such as Conviva and NPAW (Nice People at Work) directly into its own performance data and provide comprehensive analytics across multiple points in the delivery chain. By combining detailed measurement and analysis of the health and performance of the channel across multiple regions with broad client analytics data, live operations teams can now not only rapidly identify faults in the production and delivery of their channels, but immediately understand and measure the viewer impacts - an essential tool in providing a world-class experience.",,1.0,"14,18",0.0,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second is that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is very low for those younger than 50 with uncompromised immune systems, but dramatically increases for those older than 50.

I appreciated the ease of use for adding media and creating Presentations. Both the web UI and USB Fusion app were simple to use. I liked how information added to Presentations was automatically saved. Features that stood out to me were video playback, screencasting, and the ability to add webpages. I also thought the annotation and  telestration features were outstanding. The video playback features make it easy for presenters and producers to share videos during a production. The ability to share information on local devices with screencasting and to share webpages gives streaming producers more ideas for what they can do in their productions. I also appreciate the ad hoc and scheduled recording option on USB Fusion. This allows producers to confirm that their content is recorded. For viewing the audio levels of sources, it would be helpful if there were wider VU meters to make it easier to see them.
